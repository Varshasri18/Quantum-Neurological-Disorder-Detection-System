# Quantum Neurological Disorder Detection System

A final year B.E. project developed using Python, Machine Learning, and simulated quantum sensing to detect neurological disorders. Built under the Computer Science & Engineering department at MVJ College of Engineering, this system aims to assist in early diagnosis of conditions like epilepsy, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s through non-invasive, real-time brain signal analysis.

## Overview

This system uses simulated brain signals (focused on alpha and beta wave bands) to classify neurological states as normal or pathological. By combining signal processing, machine learning, and a user-friendly dashboard, the project presents an innovative step toward intelligent healthcare solutions.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* NumPy, Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Streamlit (for dashboard)
* Simulated Quantum Sensor Data
* Random Forest Classifier

## Key Features

* Synthetic brainwave generation (alpha & beta waves)
* Signal noise removal using bandpass filters
* Feature extraction using statistical metrics (mean, variance, etc.)
* Classification of brain states using Random Forest
* Real-time diagnostic dashboard for visualization
* Modular structure and ready for cloud integration

## Future Scope

* Integration with real EEG/MEG datasets
* Quantum machine learning models (QNN, Q-SVM)
* Cloud-based diagnostic platform
* Use in clinical setups with live data from quantum sensors
* Expansion to deep learning for higher classification accuracy
